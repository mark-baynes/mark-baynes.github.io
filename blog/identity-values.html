            <li><em>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</em></li><br>
            I remember when working on a cruise ship, one time I saw the staff captain throw things off the back of the ship which I believed was a waste and I took issue with what was being done. So I wrote a letter to the captain letter him know that his 2ic had done this. I guess I was interested in justice and doing what I thought was the right thing. I still hold that 'defender of the wronged' approach now to be honest.</p><br>
            <li><em>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</em></li><br>
            Growing up in the UK and since moving to NZ has allowed me to reflect on my upbringing. For example, the UK is more formal generally than New Zealand. I have noticed that the 'number 8 wire' attitude has had an impact on my career choices, which has given me a sense of empowerment, I guess.</p><br>
            <li><em>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</em></li><br>
            I am tenacious and almost always push through on an activity until it is mastered (to a degree). I am an active thinker and like to get obsessed with things. I see obsession as a positive thing, the drive contained within helps to move tasks from the conscious to the subconscious via repetition. The skills I have learned as a professional musician will probably help in this course.</p><br>
            <li><em>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</em></li><br>
            I am a mature student at Dev Academy, and I must be careful not to be hard on myself if things take a little longer. At this stage, it is unknown as to whether they will or not.</p><br>
            <li><em>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</em></li><br>
            When I first started teaching at a polytech in Auckland, other heads of department sometimes used manipulation techniques to try and achieve their goals, sometimes to my detriment. I was probably a little reactive and shut down a little at certain meetings, which created cooperation 'barriers'. Learning to control my emotions and to trust that things aren't always how you feel them is probably a wiser move. Allowing time to reflect on things is probably a good strategy, as it allows for emotions to subside.</p><br>
