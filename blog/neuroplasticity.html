      <h1>Research Neuroplasticity</h1>
      <h2>Benefits of Understanding Neuroplasticity</h2>
      Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people by empowering them to actively shape and improve their
      brain function throughout their lives. This knowledge enables individuals to engage in targeted mental exercises,
      rehabilitation techniques, and lifestyle changes that can enhance learning, memory, cognitive abilities, and recovery
      from brain injuries or neurological conditions.
      
      <h2>Engaging with Neuroplasticity Principles</h2>
      As a musician, my continuous quest to learn new things and enhance my playing naturally aligns with the principles of
      neuroplasticity. By setting specific goals, employing working-resting-working approaches, reinforcing concepts in
      various contexts, and applying them in practice, I actively engage my brain's capacity for change. Through this
      deliberate practice, I stimulate and strengthen neural pathways, allowing my brain to adapt, refine, and expand its
      musical abilities
      
      <h2>Ways to Increase Neuroplasticity</h2>
      I like doing puzzles with my daughter like the Rubiks Cube, I try to sleep well, 
      maintain a healthy diet and get some exercise (although that could be improved)
      
      <h2>Resource on Neuroplasticity</h2>
      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/This-Your-Brain-Music-Obsession/dp/0452288525" target="_blank">This Is Your Brain on
        Music</a>
      
      <h1>Research Growth Mindset</h1>
      <h2>What is Growth Mindset and Its Relevance</h2>
      Having a growth mindset is relevant because it fosters resilience, perseverance, and a love for learning, enabling
      individuals to embrace challenges, view failures as opportunities for growth, and continuously develop their abilities.
      It promotes a positive attitude towards learning, enhances problem-solving abilities, and supports personal, academic,
      and professional growth.
      
      <h2>Surprises and Changes in Exploration</h2>
      I have taught neuroplasticity as part of a music degree. I love this topic and have engaged with it regulalry throughout the years.
      
      <h2>Integrating Growth Mindset into Learning Journey</h2>
      I integrate a growth mindset into my learning journey by embracing challenges as opportunities for growth (somtimes lol) and
      learning. I often approach setbacks and failures with resilience, viewing them as stepping stones to improvement rather
      than indicators of fixed abilities. I seek out feedback and constructive criticism to identify areas for
      development and actively engage in continuous learning and self-improvement. 
      
      <h1>Blend with Learning Plan and Strategies</h1>
      <h2>Reflection on the Influence of Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h2>
      I'm proud of the progress I've made in coding, and I'm confident it will continue. The repetition in the course has been
      invaluable in solidifying my understanding. It has made coding concepts more natural to me and improved my skills
      through consistent practice. The repetition has also reinforced the importance of these concepts, boosting my confidence
      and fluency in coding. That said, there is no rest for the wicked, and there is more more to do!
