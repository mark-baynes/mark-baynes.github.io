      <h1>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h1>

      <li><em>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</em></li><p></p>
      Still to gain employment in the it sector as a programmer, either full or part time and establish some sort of job stability<p></p>
      <li><em>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</em></li><p></p>
      Perhaps an emotional limitation might be that I am pretty hard on myself, so I will need to make sure that I am doing ok in the course, probably seeking external feedback. 
      As a strength I am able to put more effort into something if I am not cutting it.<p></p>
      <li><em>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</em></li>
      Finances I imagine, at this stage, and juggling performances as they come in.<p></p>
      <li><em>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</em><p></p>
      I guess it would be good to get better at listening still, and online collaboration.<p></p>
      <li><em>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</em></li><p></p>
      I am very much looking forward to the technical and other one-on-one classes, but it seems like so far the team are supporting me when I put my hand up.
      I would like that to continue.<p></p>
      <li><em>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</em></li><p></p>
        To improve my confidence, speed, coding, and get to the point where I can earn a living.
      <h1>Foundations Learning Plan</h1>
        <li><em>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</em></li>
      To become employed part or full time as a developer and see how it goes. One direction maybe to use my new skills to build music related sites, perhaps integrating with AI technology (super long term goal). Another is to learn python, or try to get a job with Serrato (I would need C++). Honestly, it has only been intuition that has led me to this course.<p></p>
      <li><em>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</em></li>
      I am very self-motivated and like to keep on track. I guess as much as I get obsessed with things, I can also lose interest after some time, but I almost always finish projects that I have started. I sometimes move quite quickly which means I may well forget things and need to relearn.<p></p>
      <li><em>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</em></li>
      Perhaps working with others, in particularly younger generations.<p></p>
      <li><em>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</em></li>
      Well this course is part time which suits my needs very well. Some days I have all day to study, other days I have no time at all. I work well with coffee and a quiet space. Having studied at postgraduate level for many years I feel like I know how to manage my workload, and the sprint deadlines seem to be a reasonable indicator of how I am progressing. I am not really working with others at this stage but I guess that will change as the course moves on, and my aim is to maintain respectful and open dialogue during all interactions. When things get tough, I tend to launch myself at the problem rather than run away. I imagine me applying the same tactic during my study, but usually I am studying other types of things not web development, so we shall see!<p></p>
      <li><em>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</em></li>
      I have and will continue to reach out when I get stuck, probably on Discord on the helpdesk channel.<p></p>
      <li><em>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</em></li>
      Timely, helpful, friendly, and accurate information for when I get stuck! Thus far I have!<p></p>
