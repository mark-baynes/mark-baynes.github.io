      <em>Reflection on Problem-Solving Techniques</em><br>
      <br><br>
      <li>Pseudocode<em><br>I find pseudocode extremely helpful in breaking down complex problems into smaller steps. It allows me to plan and
      organize my thoughts before diving into coding. However, it is the most challenging part of coding too.</em></li>
      <br><br>
      <li>Trying Something<br><em>Yes, really useful, and when it doesn't work comparing it to the working version often I find I am not that far off. It also helps me not to be reliant on external sources.</em></li><br>
     <br><br>
      <li>Rubber Duck Method<br><em>I actually have not tried this method yet.</em></li><br>
      <br><br>
      <li>Reading Error Messages<br><em>This has been vital in my learning for sprint 4, really useful to see where my mistakes are. I don't always understand the messages though.</em></li><br>
     <br><br>
      <li>Console.logging<br><em>I have just insdtalled an extension that allows me to console log. It was useful for the sprints however running the tests on this occasion felt more useful as the test reporting was more thorough.</em></li><br>
      <br><br>
      <li>Googling<br><em>Yes of course! And also ChatGPT, although I am resisting it before I have reied other methods. I would like to spend more time on MDN too. Videos on coding are cool to watch while I play the piano.</em></li><br>
      <br><br>
      <li>Asking Peers for Help<br><em>Rich was helpful when I was stuck in the first week, but I haven't really asked for peer support since, probably as we are online.</em></li><br>
      <br><br>
      <li>Asking Coaches for Help<br><em>Yes, when necessary I have reached out, but I have not generally done this initially, I usually prefer to problem solve myself, although sometimes it does lead me down a rabbit hole.</em></li><br>
      <br><br>
      <li>Improving your process with reflection<br><em>Kindof always running through things in my mind during the day, especially when I have been coding alot.</em></li><br>
      <br><br>
      <li>Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so.<br></li><em>Sure, I would like some one on one time with tutors at some point to try and fill in the gaps. Sometimes I feel like I dont want to bother onyone, but I think that bigger problems in Bootcamp will require more collaboration. Sometimes it feels like asking the specific question would take more time than finding the answer.</em></li><br>
