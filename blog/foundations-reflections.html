    <em>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</em>
    <p></p>
    Acutually one of the first things I learnt was something that Elise said, that folk moving field often get competency whiplash. 
    I have been mindful of this and tried to minimise that feeling when it arose. My ego, lol. Yes we all have that don't we. 
    I am not sure how to answer that one. I guess having time to reflect detatches one from ones ego to a certain degree. I am aware that I have much to learn.
    I am pleased that I can apply learning principles from learning music, and apply them to learning javascript.<p></p>
    <em>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</em>
    <p></p>
    Values guide ethical decision-making and prioritize integrity in work.
    Empathy fosters effective collaboration, user-centric design, and consideration of societal impact.
    Self-awareness enables personal growth, leveraging strengths, and identifying areas for improvement.
    Integrating these qualities alongside technical skills creates well-rounded programmers who contribute positively to
    teams and culture.<p></p>
   
    <em>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</em>
    <p></p>
    I am open minded enoughto know that there is probably a good reason to include core learning principles to this extent, 
    however at this stage I am surpirsed by the amount in the programme. Time will tell, I am sure I am in good hands.
    <p></p>
    <em>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</em><p></p>
    Finding some budding time to pair up with other people is a challenge, and of course the deep listening exercises. Not always so good at that!
    <p></p>
    <em>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development
    Bootcamp course?</em><p></p>
I am not sure yet
<p></p>
    <em>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to
    practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</em><p></p>
Yes a little. I always try and rush through it, but I am open to being drawn in if and when the need really arises.
