Yes, emotional intelligence and mindfullness in general is something that I have been working on for a while. Being an teacher and a musician, being able to work with people is an essential skill. Mindfullness techniques include daily mediation, trying not to react quickly, and positive reenforcement. It is still a work in progress mind!
