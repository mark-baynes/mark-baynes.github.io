    <p> Welcome to JazzPiano.co.nz, a platform where you can learn jazz piano from a seasoned pianist with a contemporary flair. My name is Dr. Mark Baynes, and I am based in West Auckland, New Zealand. I have a strong background in jazz and popular music performance as a performer, composer, accompanist, teacher, and mentor.</p>
    <p>
      My teaching style is fun yet focused, aimed at helping students enjoy learning the piano, build skills and confidence, and develop a solid repertoire. I teach all ages and abilities from my home studio in West Auckland, and I offer lessons in:
    </p>
    <ul class="indented-list">
      <li>reading and technique</li>
      <li>improvisation (beginners to advanced)</li>
      <li>styles (Funk, Jazz, Latin, Pop, etc.)</li>
      <li>composition and songwriting</li>
      <li>music theory</li>
      <li>music production</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In my extensive experience in the music industry, I have collaborated with acclaimed artists like Troy Kingi, Latin Grammy Award Winner Mireya Ramos, the Royal New Zealand Ballet, and the Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra. I have also worked as a musical director in the Middle East and as a pianist/MD for ProShip (Canada), and have performed alongside jazz giants such as Eric Marienthal.
    </p>
    <p>As a presenter of 95bFM’s The Jazz Show and a columnist for NZ Musician Magazine, I stay up-to-date with the latest trends in jazz and popular music. I am also involved in curriculum development and have sat on the NZQA panel tasked with reviewing unit standards for music technology L1-3. I run Networks of Expertise workshops teaching popular music analysis to secondary school teachers and review achievement standards at secondary school level at NCEA levels 1-3 on the Music Subject Experts Group.</p>
    <p>On this website, you’ll find a wealth of resources to help you learn jazz piano, including a special focus on the music of Brad Mehldau. Whether you’re just starting out or you’re an experienced player, I can provide you with the guidance and tools you need to build your skills and deepen your understanding of music.</p>
    <p>I invite you to join me on this journey of musical discovery.<br><br>
    Dr Mark Baynes</p>
